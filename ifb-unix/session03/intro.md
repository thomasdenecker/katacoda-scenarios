Welcome!

During this course, you will learn how to manipulate files and folders.

The left panel will contain the explanations and guides to run command lines. Use the right panel to type the command examples and experiment as you wish.

During the course, some instructions will be explained. They will appear in the left pannel on a grey background (<code class="lang-bash" style="background: #f6f8fa;">like this</code>) and must be typed in the right window. Their text or value can be modified if you wish, but in order to answer questions or quizzes, we advise you to type the proposed instructions exactly as they are.
